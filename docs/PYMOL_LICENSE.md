## GPU-accelerated rendering (NVIDIA)

When the container is run with **`--gpus all`** (and the host has NVIDIA drivers), PyMOL is launched with **VirtualGL** (`vglrun`) so that OpenGL rendering uses the GPU:

- A headless X server (display **:0**) is started with the NVIDIA driver for 3D.
- The VNC desktop uses display **:0** (served via x11vnc on port 5901). PyMOL runs OpenGL directly on **:0** (GPU).
- If no GPU is present, PyMOL falls back to software rendering and the container still runs.

Ensure the host has the NVIDIA driver and the container is started with `docker run --gpus all ...` (or equivalent) for GPU-accelerated molecular viewing.
